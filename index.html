					        <p>The 12 Tasks Challenge is a real life travel adventure game.</p>
					        <p>It's been described as an exotic mix of treasure hunt, magical mystery tour, travel adventure and charity challenge. Your team will be given fun and challenging tasks which are designed to immerse you into the country and experience it in an new and unique way.</p>
					        <p>It is a game - with a winner and a prize - but it is not a race (although there may be a race within the game). We prefer to travel slow and deep, search out the less trodden tracks and give you time to appreciate people and places.</p>
					        <p>The Thailand Challenge kicks off in Bangkok with the opening night welcome party. For the next 12 days you will take part in a series of adventures, tasks and challenges in different parts of the country. On the last night is the celebration dinner where the winner is crowned and memories, food and drink are shared. The winning team will be invited back as our guests to defend their title.</p>

					      	<p>The 12 Tasks is for adventurous people who want to explore a country, its people, and its culture. You should enjoy being pushed outside your comfort zone and embrace the opportunity to deal with new and unexpected situations.</p>
					      	<p>Although many aspects are organised for you - and we will be in country to assist you if needed - this is not a tour and you should be ready to travel independently in a foreign country.</p>
					      	<p>It is not necessary to be competitive but it helps if you are trying to win!</p>
					      	<p>There are 2 people in each team, so it's best if you enter together. If you really can't find a teammate then let us know and we might be able to pair you up with someone.</p>

					        <p>The amount of time you spend with the other teams is largely up to you. Some tasks are group tasks but these will generally be in bigger cities where you will also have the space to do your own thing if you want. In rural areas we try to avoid staying in groups which might spoil the interactions with the local people.</p><p>On the road, the route is designed with enough flexibility so that no two teams will follow the same course - unless they choose to. We will all be together for the welcome party, the final dinner and usually a rendezvous somewhere in the middle.</p>

					        <p>After you've completed the registration process, we will set your team up with your own 12 Tasks blog. You will use this (together with social media) to complete some of the tasks - as well for your own blogging pleasure!</p>
					        <p>On arrival in Bangkok, we will give you a welcome pack containing various goodies - including the all important local SIM card (with internet access) and the highly sought after 12 Tasks t-shirts.</p>
					        <p>During the game, most of your accommodation is provided, some of your meals, most of your transport in Thailand as well as the fees for your core tasks. We can't say exactly, as each game is unique, but on average you will need to find 2-3 nights accommodation by yourself as part of the game.</p>
					        <p>Also included is the opening party, final dinner, plus of course your Task Masters (that's us!) who will be with you in Thailand in person and reachable by phone throughout the game. All in all, your extra expenditure could be as little as Â£100 - but this is entirely up to you.</p>

					        <p>Some tasks will require you to spend some money but in that case the costs will be minimal - or at least you will have the choice of how much to spend. All major expenses are included in your entry fee.</p>
					        <p>It would be possible to complete the game with only about Â£100 of spending money but most people would want to budget Â£200 - Â£400 for treats like drinks & massages. Of course if you choose to spend your evenings sipping champagne then the sky's the limit - and you probably won't be asking this question anyway!</p>
