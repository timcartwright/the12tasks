					        <p>The 12 Tasks Challenge is a real life travel adventure game.</p>
					        <p>It's been described as an exotic mix of treasure hunt, magical mystery tour, travel adventure and charity challenge. Your team will be given fun and challenging tasks which are designed to immerse you into the country and experience it in an new and unique way.</p>
					        <p>It is a game - with a winner and a prize - but it is not a race (although there may be a race within the game). We prefer to travel slow and deep, search out the less trodden tracks and give you time to appreciate people and places.</p>
					        <p>The Thailand Challenge kicks off in Bangkok with the opening night welcome party. For the next 12 days you will take part in a series of adventures, tasks and challenges in different parts of the country. On the last night is the celebration dinner where the winner is crowned and memories, food and drink are shared. The winning team will be invited back as our guests to defend their title.</p>

Some tasks are group tasks but these will generally be in bigger cities where you will have the space to do your own thing - or socialise with the others - in your spare time. In rural areas we try to avoid staying in groups which might spoil the interactions with the local people.</p><p>On the road, the route is designed with enough flexibility so that no two teams will follow the same course - unless they choose to. We will all be together for the welcome party, the final dinner and usually a rendezvous somewhere in the middle.</p>

					        <p>It is not a physical challenge, but there are tasks which will require a reasonable level of fitness.</p>
					        <p>To give you an idea of the level of fitness required, you should be comfortable hiking up a mountain path or spending a few hours walking around under the tropical sun.</p>
					        <p>An easy and enjoyable way to get fit is by joining your local <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk" target="_blank">Parkrun</a>

					        <p>After you've completed the registration process, we will set your team up with your own 12 Tasks blog. You will use this (together with social media) to complete some of the tasks - as well for your own blogging pleasure!</p>
					        <p>On arrival in Bangkok, we will give you a welcome pack containing various goodies - including the all important local SIM card (with internet access) and the highly sought after 12 Tasks t-shirts.</p>
					        <p>During the game, most of your accommodation is provided, some of your meals, most of your transport in Thailand as well as the fees for your compulsary tasks. We can't say exactly, as each game is unique, but on average you will need to find 2-3 nights accommodation by yourself as part of the game.</p>
					        <p>Also included is the opening party, final dinner, plus of course your Task Masters (that's us!) who will be with you in Thailand in person and reachable to help you throughout the game. All in all, your extra expenditure could be as little as £100 - but this is entirely up to you.</p>
